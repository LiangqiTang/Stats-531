In class, we saw results for ARMA models fitted to two different time intervals. Here are the full R fitted model summaries for data up to 2018 and 2020:

```{r compare}
y <- read.table(file="ann_arbor_weather.csv",header=1)
arma2018 <- arima(y$Low[y$Year<=2018], order=c(1,0,1))
arma2018
arma2020 <- arima(y$Low[y$Year<=2020], order=c(1,0,1))
arma2020
```

What do you conclude by comparing these fitted models? Do you notice anything surprising?
