abstract = {Background
Brucellosis has always been one of the major public health problems in China. Investigating the influencing factors of brucellosis is conducive to its prevention and control. The incidence trend of brucellosis shows an obvious seasonality, suggesting that there may be a correlation between brucellosis and meteorological factors, but related studies were few. We aimed to use the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to analyze the relationship between meteorological factors and brucellosis.
Methods
The data of monthly incidence of brucellosis and meteorological factors in Hebei province from January 2004 to December 2015 were collected from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center and Chinese meteorological data website. An ARIMA model incorporated with covariables was conducted to estimate the effects of meteorological variables on brucellosis.
Results
There was a highest peak from May to July every year and an upward trend during the study period. Atmospheric pressure, wind speed, mean temperature, and relative humidity had significant effects on brucellosis. The ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)12 model with the covariates of atmospheric pressure, wind speed and mean temperature was the optimal model. The results showed that the atmospheric pressure with a 2-month lag (Î²â€¯=â€¯âˆ’0.004, pâ€¯=â€¯0.037), the wind speed with a 1-month lag (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.030, pâ€¯=â€¯0.035), and the mean temperature with a 2-month lag (Î²â€¯=â€¯âˆ’0.003, pâ€¯=â€¯0.034) were significant predictors.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that atmospheric pressure, wind speed, mean temperature, and relative humidity have a significant impact on brucellosis. Further understanding of its mechanism would help facilitate the monitoring and early warning of brucellosis.}

abstract = {At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China. As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.}
