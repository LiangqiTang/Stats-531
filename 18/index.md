We return to another case study from the short course [Simulation-Based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) (SBIED). Chapter 18 is Lesson 7 of SBIED. 
We will focus on two new topics arising in the case study:

* Non-likelihood model criticism. So far, we have emphasized likelihood-based tools both for model fitting and diagnostic criticism. Here, we consider other statistics.

* Forecasts using POMP models can combine uncertainty due to stochasticity in the latent process, the measurement noise, and unknown parameters. We see how this plays out in an example.
