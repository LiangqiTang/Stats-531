-----------

Each homework receives a numerical score for Contribution (10 points) and Scholarship (5 points).

DATASCI/STATS 531 permits and encourages the use of all sources, as well as collaboration. A strong homework solution should acknowledge the sources used and demonstrate original contribution going beyond its sources. The most common reason for unsatisfactory performance in this course is failure to adequately explain the role of sources in the midterm or final project. In extreme cases, this can amount to plagiarism. To make sure that expectations of scholarship are clear, we emphasize the importance of good scholarship in all the homeworks. 

------------

## Scholarship

**A source is anything or anyone you consulted (including classmates or office hours or any website you visited) to help you write or check your answers.**

Scholarship points may be removed retroactively if at some later point it becomes clear that unattributed sources were being used.

(5 points). The howework is explicit about what sources were and were not used. The reader can easily tell which parts of the homework relate to which of the listed sources. This is usually done by citing the source at each point it was used, and listing the full reference at the end.

(4 points). Sources are explicit, but it is sometimes unclear which parts of the homework relate to which sources. Or, there are some points which could be improved by a suitable reference.

(3 points). Sources are explicit, but no effort is made to describe which parts of the homework relate to which sources. Or, there are many points which could be improved by a suitable reference.

(0 points). Failure to list sources explicitly, even if just to say that none were used. Since credit is assigned for being explicit about sources it is necessary also to be explicit about lack of sources. Otherwise, the grader cannot tell the difference between failure to list sources and the possibility that the work was done entirely independently of the notes, the internet and all colleagues.

## Contribution

This is standard homework grading except for an additional requirement to demonstrate contribution of original effort beyond any source you use.

(10 points). All solutions are correct. If checked against a source, the homework is explicit about how the individual solution differs from the source and what (if anything) was learned from the source. The student has found a way to show that they contributed beyond any source used. In particular, the two should not look too similar---by consulting a source, you acquire an obligation to differentiate your own work, which could be by adding original material relevant to the question which go beyond the source.

Points subtracted for each error or omission or failure to explain a contribution beyond the sources used.
